# Hangman - Winter vibes
This is a simple web-based game similar to Hangman, where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before the snowman melts.


# How to Play
1. The game will randomly choose a word from the list and display it as a series of underscores, one for each letter in the word.
2. You must guess a letter by clicking on the corresponding button on the screen.
3. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position.
4. If the letter is not in the word, the snowman will begin to melt. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses       before  the snowman melts completely and the game ends.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either reveal the entire word or the snowman melts.
